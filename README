STIters is a little library that adds Smalltalk-style collection iterators to Kotlin. STIters was started as some little initial Kotlin programming exercise. Meanwhile it has become partially obsolete as Kotlin has its own standard library now named stdlib that provides many of the collection iterators found in STIters. Nevertheless, STIters contains some useful iterators in addition and for the time being fixes some problems with iterators in stdlib as included in the Kotlin plugin 0.1.2090 or earlier (see KT-1859). Requires Kotlin 0.1.2090 or newer.
